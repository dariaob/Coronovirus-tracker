# Coronovirus-tracker
This is coronovirus-tracker. It takes data from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 and shows this in rows and columns.
Following step by step this Spring project of Java Brains I've learnt lot of about Spring, thymeleaf and HTTP. Thanks to Java Brains! I really enjoyed this tutorial.
